<h4>Sinopse A comprehensive introduction to all facets of MPLS theory and practice Helps networking professionals choose the suitable MPLS application and design for their network Provides MPLS theory and relates to basic IOS configuration examples The Fundamentals Series from Cisco Press launches the basis to readers for understanding the purpose, application, and management of technologies MPLS has emerged as the new networking layer for service providers throughout the world. For many service providers and enterprises MPLS is a way of delivering new applications on their IP networks, while consolidating data and voice networks. MPLS has grown to be the new default network layer for service providers and is finding its way into enterprise networks as well. This book focuses on the building blocks of MPLS (architecture, forwarding packets, LDP, MPLS and QoS, CEF, etc.). This book also reviews the different MPLS applications (MPLS VPN, MPLS Traffic Engineering, Carrying IPv6 over MPLS, AToM, VPLS, MPLS OAMetc.).You will get a comprehensive overview of all the aspects of MPLS, including the building blocks, its applications, troubleshooting and a perspective on the future of MPLS.</h4>

<h4>Sinopse : A practical guide to understanding, designing, and deploying MPLS and MPLS-enabled VPNs In-depth analysis of the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) architecture Detailed discussion of the mechanisms and features that constitute the architecture Learn how MPLS scales to support tens of thousands of VPNs Extensive case studies guide you through the design and deployment of real-world MPLS/VPN networks Configuration examples and guidelines assist in configuring MPLS on Cisco devices Design and implementation options help you build various VPN topologies Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is an innovative technique for high-performance packet forwarding. There are many uses for this new technology, both within a service-provider environment and within the enterprise network, and the most widely deployed usage today is the enabling of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). With the introduction of MPLS-enabled VPNs, network designers are able to better scale their networks than with the methods available in the past. Network engineers and administrators need quick, effective education on this technology to efficiently deploy MPLS-enabled VPNs within their networks. With that goal in mind, MPLS and VPN Architectures provides an in-depth discussion particular to Cisco's MPLS architecture. This book covers MPLS theory and configuration, network design issues, and case studies as well as one major MPLS application: MPLS-based VPNs. The MPLS/VPN architecture and all its mechanisms are explained with configuration examples, suggested design and deployment guidelines, and extensive case studies. MPLS and VPN Architectures is your practical guide to understanding, designing, and deploying MPLS and MPLS-based VPNs.</h4>
